# VSCODE Devcontainer for Arduino

This is a self-contained environment that allows compiling and uploading
Arduino source code without having to install anything on your computer, beside VSCode and Docker. It uses the VSCode's devcontainer built-in feature.

## Licensing

The included Docker file, the devcontainer.json file and the hello-world sample are licensed under the MIT License. All other files are governed by their respective licenses.

## How it works

This devcontainer is based on Microsoft's CPP devcontainer using Debian and contains the required extensions to facilitate Arduino development.  
The devcontainer is configured to launch the container with `--privileged` options. This is required to access the serial ports from inside the Docker container. If your feel unsafe about that, you can remove this option and add an UDEV rule to configure the file permissions on the Arduino device automatically.

## Environment

This devcontainer has been tested with the following environment:

- Fedora 36
- Docker 20.10.17
- VSCode 1.69.2

## How to use the devcontainer

1) Open the project in VSCode: `File->Open Folder`
2) Reopen it in devcontainer:
   1) `CTRL+SHIFT+P` to open the command pallet
   2) `Remote-Containers: Reopen in container`

## Inside the devcontainer

Most of the option below are also available from the status bar

### Selecting the Board

From the command pallet, type `Arduino: Board config`

### Opening the serial monitor

From the command pallet, type `Arduino: Open serial monitor`

### Opening the library manager

From the command pallet, type `Arduino: Library manager`

### Working with the code

`ALT-CTRL-R`: Compile only  
`ALT-CTRL-U`: Compile and upload to the Arduino device

## External librairies

If you need to install external librairies, use the `arduino-cli lib install` command. See the end of the Docker files for more information.
